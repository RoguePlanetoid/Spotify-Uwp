# Spotify.Uwp

Spotify API .NET Standard SDK Library for Universal Windows Platform Extensions

## Migration Guide

Previous **Beta** versions of **Spotify.Uwp** package were available prior to **1.0.0 Initial Release**.

Any applications using **Beta** versions of the package will have to be updated, for now you can look at the [Spotify Showcase](https://github.com/RoguePlanetoid/Spotify-Uwp-Showcase) application for guidance on what you need to change.

This **Migration Guide** will be updated with more information in the near future to help with the process.
